### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m just your average beer & coffee drinking software developer and sysadmin in PDX.
When I told people I was moving here, nobody was surprised. This may have something
to do with the toe shoes. Iâ€™m a Developer Advocate,
which basically means that I know how to talk to developers outside the company and
to developers inside the company and I can help them to be friends with each other.
I get to play with all the cool new tools and help others learn how to do it for real.

When I started in this industry, I was in professional services, which meant that I visited
exotic places like Denver and Columbus and teach people to use Puppet or help them
integrate it into their infrastructure. Now most of my travel is to blab at
conferences and such.

- ðŸ”­ðŸ“½ðŸ¤” My major project is [binford2k/showoff](https://github.com/binford2k/showoff),
  for which I'm always interested in collaboration and help with. I do have a bunch of
  other smaller projects going, some are pinned below and some can be found in my unholy
  mess of repositories. Someday I'll clean those up.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve been poking at Rust a bit lately, and want to rewrite [binford2k/abalone](https://github.com/binford2k/abalone)
  in something closer to the metal.
- ðŸŒŽ Places on the interwebs where I sometimes put words
    - https://binford2k.com
    - https://goatops.com
    - https://www.wasitfreespeech.com
- ðŸ“« I'm [@binford2k](https://hachyderm.io/@binford2k) in all the other places too.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he) or anything respectful
- ðŸ›¼ My partner is a founding member of a few roller derby leagues/teams and we're
  pretty active in that world. So if you've never seen a bout and you want to, hit
  me up!
